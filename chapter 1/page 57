'Halt at once and state your purpose witch.'says an obnoxious Khazakian warrior fending off raiders with his
other Khazakian comrades, as we approach their forces, near the carriage. 'Commander Milkry I bring a mage that can
aid us greatly in battle.He managed to best my defenders but is now bound to my will by means of a spell.I thought it
wise to make use of his talents so as to ensure our victory in this battle and to imprison him afterwards so he can
answer for his transgressions to the Lord our King in Lygrinth.' She states with sheer and noticeable reverence.'Once
again witch, you besmirch the name of my King with your foolishness by bringing me this filth that just slaughtered our
men.I shant allow you to disgrace my Lord again, brothers kill both of them.' He says imperiously and at his word
the Khazakian warriors quickly gather around us.
