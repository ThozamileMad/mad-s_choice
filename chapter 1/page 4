I reach for a knife,in my satchel then sprint towards Victor,and lunge at him.Victor evades the attack, and
kicks me aside,then grabs the man by his neck and lifts him above his feet.After waving his sword tauntingly
for a moment, he drives it into the man's chest with unpleasant crack.The man starts gasping for air.Breathing
with immense difficulty and gradually grows more quiet,and starts whispering in Oxcalrian tongue - 'Wait are those
incantations is he conjuring a spell and why is that sinister smile still on his face?',I think to myself.
