I release a wide spread of flames from my palms.The blaze engulfs the royal guards and the mage.I cease after
a while longer only to realize after that my flames didn't faze them.The guards had their shields raised, damn
I can tell from the glow on their shields the mage is reinforcing their defences with magic, I should have expected
this, however there's no time to wallow.One of the mage's guards are coming.I prepare another spell but the
approaching guard hurls his spear with immense power striking me right in the chest.
