As we near the mountain of Valhalla,we see smoke arising from somewhere within the forest.Along
with screams,explosions and tremors punctuating in the sky.'Lets dismount here and investigate.'I
say,we get off our horses and hitch them to a tree,strap on our weapons then enter a thicket on foot
towards the source of the chaos.
