Immediately I outstretch my hands and unleash a swath of flames.Engulfing the entire group in a hot
blaze,they scream hysterically in agony as the flames devour every part of their bodies,their lives
slowly ebbing away.Unfortunately my flames have engulfed other clustered fighters in the area and
they all run erratically hopelessly trying to extinguish the flames.In a frenzy one of the burning
men grabs me screeching for help and scalding me in the process.I kick him away and pat my clothes to
snuff out the flames he spread onto me.
