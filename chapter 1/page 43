I groan as the curses toxic mana courses through me transforming me into a massive brute, then lunge at the
guards.The first pair hold up their shields defensively,but I ram my shoulder into the them and breach their
defences.I grab one of the pair and throw them at the other.Another pair of the five guards quickly converge
on me as the other stays at the defence of the mage and lacerate me with their swords and spears.I punch one
and bash him to death with his shield then break the others neck  with my bear hands.The last guards shouts,
'Lady Alacross stand behind me, I shall slay this abomination.'Then he waits for me to come near.I smirk then
pounce at him but my hand passes through him.He starts to fade away and vanishes.'An illusion, that wretched
mage!' I exclaim.I raise my head to look at the mage but hes gone.The curse starts to falter and my body returns
to it's original shape, although for some strange reason my legs become numb and I can't move.
