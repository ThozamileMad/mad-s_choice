I use spell on him and something I didn't anticipate occurs - he resists.We engage in a mental struggle
for a moment,he tries with all his might to force me out of his mind but In the end I seize control.
Afterwards my nose starts bleeding as an earsplitting headache throbs in my head.I command the man
to kill himself and without yield and he thrusts his sword into his abdomen as I dash away from the giant
to the side but it's sweeping hammer hits me slightly,sending me spinning to the side.Dazed from the
hit I fall on my knees as the rampaging giant continues charging forward,destroying everything in it's
path.
