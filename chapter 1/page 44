With a wave of my hand I unleash a bright flash of light.Blinding the royal guards, without their sight
they are vulnerable as the fighters around begin to swarm around them and attack tearing them to pieces.
Mutilated the five guards lie in bloody heaps on the ground as the robed sorcerer stands alone and glares
at me hatefully.I smirk until suddenly my entire body goes numb and I can't move.
