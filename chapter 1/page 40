Writhing on the ground along with many other warriors I watch helplessly as the spell caster prepares
another spell to finish us off,however before he can a fire a large golem with glowing green eyes rips
itself from the ground, then squashes him with it's massive fist.The golem lowers itself and allows a
hooded figure to climb on of it 'A mage that can cast advanced lightning spells and another that can
create golems, just what kind of battle is this, what exactly are all these men fighting for?'I think
to myself as the golem trudges away with the necromancer sitting on top of it's head.
