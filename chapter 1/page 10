Blinded by rage I conjure a blazing firebolt in one hand,then throw it at him.The firebolt strikes his armour,
but extinguishes instantaneously.Stunned by how easily my spell was nullified I pause.'Oh no he's armours
enchanted,how could have i forgotten.'I think to myself,before I can even defend myself Victor rushes in,and
thrusts his sword deeply into my chest.
