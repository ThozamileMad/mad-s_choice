Immediately someone bashes me with a mace from behind.Staggering forwards I balance myself and pivot
looking at my opponent.He's drenched in blood wielding a rusty mace and has the face of a degenerate
scum, no doubt in my mind that standing before me is filthy raider.I have two options here:Use the
Corporis Amplificationem curse which I can use for only a little while to greatly enhance the size and
strength of my arm although this spell does drain my life or cut him down with my sword.
