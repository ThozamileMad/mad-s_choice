'You savages conduct your vile conspiracy to steal Minigrahasian reparations now as we converse so your flimsy attempts
to deceive me by feigning innocence is futile.Now cease your bluster.'she says with finality and points a finger
at me.I fall to my knees groaning and clutch my stomach as something hot sears my torso, the front of my robes burn
exposing my chest and the large-intricate mark of a seal appears on my torso.The wretched snake hisses then wraps
itself onto my right leg and scales upward slithering to my abdomen then plunging into the seal on my chest.The seal
glows brightly crimson for a moment as the snake merges with the seal until it's entire body vanishes into it.
