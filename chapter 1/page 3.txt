I mutter an incantation then cast a disarming spell knocking the sword out of Victor's hands,but unexpectedly
the guard,casts a telekinetic spell,enchanting the sword,he makes it hover in mid-air,then directs it at himself
and propels it into his own neck.He retches violently as blood starts gushing from his neck and starts whispering,
in Oxcalrian tongue with an sinister smile,I realise then that he's conjuring something.
