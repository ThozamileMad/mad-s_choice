Another lunatic comes swinging at me from nowhere with an axe.I deflect blow after blow,but he persists
attacking me relentlessly with a crazy look in his eyes.Suddenly a gigantic man,covered head to toe with
expensive-looking armour wielding a large stone hammer appears in the distance and charges through the fighting men,
knocking them all over the place and sweeping through them with powerful swings of his deadly weapon.This
monstrosity is headed in my direction and the fool I cross swords with doesn't seem to care and is intent
on killing me.The tremors are getting louder,I need to act fast.I could:spit into the fools face and dive
to the side or use use the mind control spell on the man and force him to stop his attacks or activate the
shield spell to protect me from both enemies.
