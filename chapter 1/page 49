I pause for moment and try my hardest to remember the letter that Victor read earlier ago.'If I am
denied entry... I will...'I stutter, failing miserably to recount Victors words.I close my eyes and
delve deep into memory 'If I am denied entry to heaven then I will dance in the fires of hell those
were the kings word's and the queen's were give me a sword and I shall... and I shall...' I stutter
again for some time until Victor's words return perfectly to memory ,'I shall show you - all my hearts
and souls.', 'It is obvious that you are not a Khazakian warrior given how you struggled to recite
the sacred words however no matter how flawed your eloquence was in reciting these words - you succeeded.
I want to know how you obtained this knowledge, so for now I will let you join me as an ally - but know
this if you betray me or hinder my effectiveness on the battlefield - I will - kill you.Furthermore I do
have - conditions.'
