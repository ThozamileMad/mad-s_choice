I cast a magical shield and hold my ground,however the beast slams it's right claw into my spell,instantly
penetrating the shield.The impact so immense,it propels me backwards.I quickly recover,then the demon closes
the distance between us hastily and swings it's left arm, aiming for my head,I lower my head to evade the
claw.Then swiftly,I unsheathe and raise my sword,deflecting another slash and swerve back to avoid a flurry
of slashes,but the wretched thing manages to cut my shoulder.
