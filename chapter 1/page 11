The men on the ground are gradually starting to move.The witch must be responsible for this,she knows that we're
here.No time to waste,I ignore this fool's provocation and start running for the exit.The wooden doors of the
main building slam loudly as I barge out and immediately mount my horse which is positioned nearby alongside
Victor's horse.The horse neighs irritated that I disturbed it from eating hay from inside the cart in front of it.'Make
fast you stupid animal lest I cook you into into stew!'I bellow imperiously,pulling the reins hard.After seizing
control of the mount I rein it forth making it gallop in the direction of the gates.Victor follows behind after
climbing his horse hastily.'Oi how dare you forsake your brother in the midst of thievery!'The lunatic bellows
maniacally,with no degree of concern about the peril he's wrought.I have grown oblivious to his rants,there is
no sense in bickering with such a man prone to insanity and folly.
