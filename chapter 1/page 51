'For I have fallen deeply in love with you Calphurnia.' I jest 'Refer to me as one of your whores again and
I will have your tongue for it, you filthy savage.'she threatens me with glint of fury in her eyes.'After
witnessing how easily I vanquished your men, you would be a fool not to see how valuable I could be in
battle.'I assert smugly.'So you offer to assist me as an ally in this mayhem - you know I could just force you,
taking into account how foolish you appear to be it should be easy to bend your will.'she remarks, countering
with a smirk.'Then do it.'I say calling her bluff, after a short pause she chuckles.'You amuse me mage,
tell me - which name you go by.', 'Sigarus - Forth Sigarus.' I say.'Well then Sigarus I accept your offer
however I do have - conditions.'
