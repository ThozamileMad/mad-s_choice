'Now!'I think to myself as they become more conspicuous and hurl a firebolt,to the one on the right sending
him thrashing in flames into the battlefield.The remaining team members flinch,taken aback - they underestimated
me and didn't know that I'm a wizard.They change strategy,splitting up and advancing towards more quickly behind
the cover of other fighters, to avoid another elemental attack.I wait for them to come closer with the smoke potion
in my grasp.

Once they get alarmingly close I throw it hard with all my strength onto the ground, it shatters,releasing
thick large smoke which envelopes the portion of the battlefield that i'm in.Thanks to the super-sight potion i am able
to identify the remaining two, the one on my left looks around in confusion but I plunge my sword into his back.The last one
panics and starts flailing his axe uncontrollably.I slash his arm and he drops his weapon hysterically then I slice his
stomach open.He falls back as his entrails spill out along with blood.Suddenly I receive a blow to the head and a laceration
to my right cheek.All the other men on the battlefield are also horrified by this smoke and swing they're weapons blindly.
Quickly and carefully I kill those that come close to me until the smoke subsides and the brawl continues.
