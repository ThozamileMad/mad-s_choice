We rustle in the greenery,searching for the fallen bird.After sometime Victor pulls it out from
a bush, removes the parchment on it's foot and starts reading it's contents.'To Lord Khazakian
the 13th:My lord I your loyal ambassador Rehelieu request that you send forces to the Northern part
of the forest near the great mountain of Valhalla,near the sacred lake.We anticipate an assault
from suspicious men that have been following us and scrutinizing our every move ever since we finalised
diplomatic negotiations with the aristocrats from Minigrahas.Their numbers are too great and I fear
they may overwhelm us.With the utmost respect I humbly implore that you act quickly,lest we lose the
item the Minigrahasians entrusted us to deliver to you - from the words of the Holy king I say If I am
denied entry to heaven I will dance in the fires of hell, from the words of the Holy Queen I say  Give
me a sword and I shall show you all my hearts and souls.'

'How great this is,now come Victor let's be opportunistic about this,I see a titanic mountain from
where we are in the distance and I'd wager that's the mountain this ambassador speaks of.'I declare.
