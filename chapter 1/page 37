I enclose myself in a shield dome.In spite of this the crazy bastard keeps attacking.His blows deflecting
off the shield.At one point he drops his sword and starts bashing the shield with his bare hands as he screams,
'I'll fucking kill you!' 'Good God your folly knows no limits.'I remark.The giant reaches me and crushes the shield
along with me inside of it with a great swing of it's hammer launching me into the air,I drift lifelessly at a deadly
height and crash somewhere on top of someone in the battlefield.I groan in intense agony and start gasping heavily until
my consciousness starts to wane and darkness envelops me.
