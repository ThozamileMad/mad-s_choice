Uttering a few words in the devils tongue I cast enhancement spell,wincing as dark magic fuels my left
arm with painful yet potent dark magic.My arm starts to grow becoming more muscular.He swings again but
this time I snatch the mace from his grasp in my enchanted left hand and throw it away.Astonished he
glances at my abnormal arm,and attempts turns to flee but I grab him with my right hand,pull him towards
me and slam my enchanted fist into his face.Instantly he collapses with a shattered face.The curse starts
subsiding and my arm starts shrinking to it's original size.
