Suddenly,an idea starts to form you look at the skies,at all the birds soaring above.I yell at Victor,'Halt at
once finally a plan has come to fruition!' Victor complies and we both halt,'Why,what plan do you speak of?'Victor
asks.Using a spell called focus,which enhances my sight I ascertained that some birds traveling through the sky
have parchment fastened to their feet denoting that they are messenger birds.

'There are birds that carry messages across the sky,we will capture these winged creatures and procure the messages
they carry,then we will then use the contents of those messages to guide us to wherever it is meant to be sent.'You
remark excitedly.Victor responds,'And enlighten me wizard how shall we capture these creatures,given that we have
legs and they have wings.'He is right there are two messenger falcons above flying ahead,they soar at a great height,
it will be a challenge to catch or kill them I could:cast the paralysis spell to render them immobile,however the paralysis
spell has a limited range or tell Victor who is adept with the bow to take them down or cast a mind control spell on the
animals in the vicinity to take them down.
