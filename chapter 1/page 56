With my movement restored we make our way towards the destroyed carriage I which was targeted by the brawling
thieves who betrayed each other and are fighting amongst themselves for what remains in the burning wreckage
according to the sorceress.Zagamish here seems to think that I am one of those raiders, but more skilled because
of my sorcery.The slithering beast within me is quite uncomfortable, I can feel a mild burning sensation inside me,
and each time I try to stray from the the sorceress, the sensation intensifies to an excruciatingly sharp pain.So
for now I follow subserviently onwards to defend the carriage and it's treasures as she bade me.
