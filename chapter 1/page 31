Suddenly a scrawny armoured combatant seems to materialise from the fray and approaches me,brandishing
a bloody sword.'Come here boy let me cut you in half.'He threatens,but unexpectedly three men converge
on him and slaughter him with an assortment of weaponry.The three fighters seem to be working together
and are now advancing towards me with the intent to kill as they cut down all enemies in their path.I
could:burn them with then scorch spell,which releases an extensive burst of flames or cast a push spell,
that creates a gust of wind to catapult a group of fighters onto them or Use a smoke potion to confuse
and kill them.
