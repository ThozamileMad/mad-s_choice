I survey the area observing all the wildlife around me.A eagle perched on a branch,to my right catches my
eye.I stare into the eagle's eye and with a flutter of my hand and an utterance,I invade it's mind,it screeches
mentally struggling against me as I forcefully attempt to seize control of it's mind,but it's resistance is
futile as I finally manage to seize control of it.Mind control is dangerous, especially when used on a different
species,some targets can successfully resist the spell,even more dangerous targets have the ability to reverse the
spell.Telepathically I command the beast 'Take flight and bring down your feathered cousins at once!' The eagle
complies and quickly flies in the direction of the falcons,lashing at one of the falcons with it's talons,the
other falcon flees cowardly as the other tries desperately to defend itself,but the eagle thrashes it in the
skies,clawing at the falcon until it becomes limp and starts descending rapidly,falling to the ground.
