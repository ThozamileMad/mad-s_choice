'Be quiet and let me brood over this,you speak so loudly and perpetually,haven't you grown tired from killing all
all those people yesterday!'I exclaim irritated by his bluster,'I accorded you no power to command me so wizard.'
he says arrogantly,'Nor did I bestow you such power that makes me a servant of yours,nor do I imply anything
that makes you think i'm in anyway superior to thee,so grow quiet so I can concoct our next plan of action,furthermore
I must ask will you be quiet or will you keep bickering unnecessarily?'I ask even more exasperated than I was.'Fine
speak I shan't but sing I shall.'Victor proclaims,I sigh defeated as Victor starts singing.
