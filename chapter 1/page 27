We identify the chaos.Observing a vicious battle from the edge of a clearing.Countless warriors
facing off in the vast clearing before me,alongside a lake.Crossing swords as explosions coming
from God knows where,riddle the battlefield with craters and in the midst of all this madness
seems to be a rather large-metallic carriage,engulfed in fire.'Shall we join the carnage or...'
Victor cuts me off with a battle cry and rushes into the battlefield.'To hell with it!' I shout
unsheathing my sword and following him into the fray.
