I start to feel a burning sensation everywhere inside me.Latched onto my right leg is a black snake,it's fangs
buried deep into my flesh.The sorcerer takes her hood off, revealing a beautiful face framed by short onyx hair
and with enchanting hazel eyes she looks at me,'Humour me before you die wizard.' she says telepathically, in a
mellow voice.For some odd reason the warriors in the area seem to be ignoring her and fight amongst themselves
instead.
