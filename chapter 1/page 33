I focus on a cluster of five men trying to kill each other,then with a few whispers and a flick of my
hand I launch them into the approaching warriors.They all collide and spread on the ground.Hastily all
of them stand and fight each other,with the formation broken the team that were coming towards me struggle
to fend off their opponents.They're probably used to fighting as a team and are dependant on each others
skills.The first one to die has his head lopped off.The second is killed with an axe.The last team member
manages to kill one of his opponents,but is physically put down and strangled to death by a screaming
lunatic.
