'Be attentive you foolish thing I walk by myself,not with anyone else,so run amok and go thrust your manhood into
some creature somewhere within this forest,away from me.'promptly he climbs off his mount and approaches me angrily.
I dismount and do the same.My fist meets his face,his fist meets mine.He grabs me and throws me to the ground,I take
a fallen branch and thwack him in the face.He seizes me once more,but before he can toss me I lift my knee into his
crotch.In a frenzy we continue to clash until we both lie on the ground - breathless.After a few minutes we collect
ourselves,mount our horses and continue our aimless journey in silence.
