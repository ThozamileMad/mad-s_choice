Tomorrow we might be attacked by Horin's cohorts,might as well rest.I lie on the grass and because I had expended so
much energy today,sleep came quick.Suddenly I start to feel an excruciating pain in my abdomen. Immediately I awaken,
to find Victor above me thrusting a knife repeatedly into my stomach.Briefly I lose consciousness and darkness envelopes
me.
