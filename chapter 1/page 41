The battle continues after the lightning dissipates.Explosions ensue in different areas of the battlefield.
Near two fighters, I sense a sharp concentration of mana from a mage who seems to be protected by a
group of five men clad in royal armour engraved with the Khazakian crest, surrounding him.The men encircling
him hold strong, cutting down all fighters that are in close proximity.The sorcerer in the middle must be partly
responsible for all the explosions if I don't execute him now I might suffer as well.The guards protecting him
are skilled royal guards wielding long swords and shields,I need to be careful in my strategy here.Any mistakes could be
fatal.Shall I: incinerate them with the Scorch spell, use the Corporis Amplificationem curse to greatly
improve my speed and brute force to engage them in melee combat, use the Flash shot spell to blind them
all with a flash of light.
