Thanks to my useful informant Victor and I targeted one of Horin's trivial strongholds,one with less guards and
fortifications.Situated in a desolate forest it was supposed to be relatively easy to loot.Now because of what
has transpired I too shall suffer the consequences,Horin will pursue us vengefully.How deeply I loathe the unhinged
bastard behind me.Just where did Wilso find this deranged man.I'll be sure to inquire next we meet.

Upon reaching the gates a guard,who seems to have recovered significant mobility,moves groggily on his knees
attempting to rise to his feet in front of the gates,obstructs your path.I could simply steer my horse around
him,or kill him(after all he could pursue us).
