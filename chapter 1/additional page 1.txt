I step over numerous angry guards on the floor and make my way into a passage with burning lanterns, 
illuminating the path. Ahead I see an expensive looking door with a sophisticated design. That must
be an important room, I think to myself as I observe it's greatness. "Whoever you are know this, your
foolishness will be your undoing, Horin shant rest until you're dead, so breathe while you still can
thief, death looms closely upon you like a shadow.', stated fearlessly by a massive guard lying vulnerably
on his back in front of the door with a large keychain holding a bunch of keys, tied to his belt.

Take the keys peacefully, 
Take the keys violently,
Take the keys dishonorably
