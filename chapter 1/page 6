The fiend sinks it's claws into the dead man's head and mouth.Ripping his body apart,slowly peeling the corpse
off itself.Inevitably freeing itself from the dead man's flesh.The creature starts falling from where he hovers,plummeting
onto the floor,along with the dead man's thick mass of blood and entrails,which dangle from the creature's
slender frame as it scrambles,struggling to get onto it's clawed feet on the slippery pool of blood and flesh
beneath,as it roars in exasperation.The bloody abomination opens it's greatly fanged mouth,releasing it's
enormous,black tongue and hastily devours all the flesh dangling on it.Afterwards it staggers forward,then rushes
at me in terrifying speed.You have a two choices you could cast a firebolt or cast a shield
