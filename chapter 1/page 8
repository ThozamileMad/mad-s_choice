Confidently I shout some incantations and hurl a firebolt at the demon,but it evades the shot with incredible
agility and continues advancing towards me.I panic and run for the exit,however it's too late the demon slashes
my back with it's sharp claw.I collapse on the floor and groan in agony.Then in a flurry slashes the demon rips me
apart.I scream in absolute horror and start to consciousness,until darkness finally envelopes me.
