After putting a great distance between ourselves and the stronghold we find nice small clearing in the forest
to set up camp.At the moment I am sitting on a log,reading a shabby spellbook that I stole many moons ago from
an unwary student belonging to the school of wizardry in Nagosaka,my city of birth.There is ample knowledge
to acquire from this stolen book however what really intrigued me is the onyx spellbook I stole from Horin's
library within his stronghold.Which I had placed beside me on the ground.I reach for the book and read it's
contents,flipping through the pages which are dilapidated,making it very difficult to read from and to make
matters worse,the language it is transcribed in is a language I know very little about.Fortunately through all
the obscurity I manage to find a passage in one of the pages that I can interpret,in Sildavian tongue it said,
'Concentrate these whispers on thy tongue then seep shall they into blood flesh and bone - Duhlaphirious Makta.'
It is quite dark though,I must say.There's a fire crackling between me and Victor,who appears to be sleeping on
the ground,today has been an exhausting day.
