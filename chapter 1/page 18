The next day,we gather our items,then proceed on the open path in the forest - aimlessly ,and of course Victor
rambles incessantly,but I just ignore him and ponder,where the hell am I going and why do still I travel with
this bloodthirsty lunatic.Even if we part ways though there is still one problem,well actually I have a mountain
of problems I need to deal with however the primary issue is where the hell am I headed to.Right now I require
information so I can make logical decisions about my destination.I direct my gaze upwards,contemplating deeply.
'Just where are we going mage,speak now.'he demands.
