Oh! The Gods shall cast me into hell for recruiting this lunatic - Victor. This psychotic animal just
mutilated Horin's wife and child. Currently we're attempting to loot coin from Horin's keep. So far 
the paralysis spell that I have been harnessing for 2 weeks has been effective. All of Horin's men lie
helplessly on the ground as we seek his hold. Immediately after Horin's diabolical act Horin's men 
begin cursing, screaming and weeping clamorously from the floor. "You psychotic fool, have you the 
slightest capacity to think! Unbelievable, with your bare hands a woman and a child! When we're finished
here I'll return you to the hell you came from! Mark my words!"

I roar with uncontrollable fury. "You would cry for a degenerate harlot and her filthy offspring, spare me
the nonsense Sigarus, now let's get to work." he remarks smugly with a sick smile on his face, as much as
I wanted to slaughter him I couldn't. Time was against us. We had to make haste and find Horin's fortune, 
lest he returns with his witch or the spell that I spent almost all my mana harnessing, dissipates. "Have
you forgotten why we're here. Search for treasure you fool! I need not remind you who this fortress belongs
to." I remark. He laughs without a shred of concern and responds, "Very well then conduct a search on this
floor and I'll take to the stairs."
