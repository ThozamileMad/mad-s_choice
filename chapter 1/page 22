I concentrate my mana as I pursue the falcons from the ground and cast the paralysis spell but it fails to
immobilise the birds,must be because the range of my spell is too short.Victor notices from my abashed
countenance that my spell was ineffective and laughs,'You useless fool!' he exclaims,then stops his horse and
dismounts.Unfastens his long bow and quiver from his horse's saddle,withdraws an arrow then takes aim and
fires.Spectacularly the arrow flies with devastating velocity and strikes the bird,which begins flapping it's
wings desperately to gain altitude,but inevitably it falls,plummeting somewhere in the greenery,a few meters
from where we are.
